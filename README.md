A personal-interest project made to be used as both a functional contact-information display for myself and a fun interactive experience with easter eggs built in!
This is a 100% hand-coded and original project made in my free time for personal development and practice.
I utilized a great deal of the concepts learned in CSC 131 at UNCW this semester.
Many of the functions and loops here could likely be reproduced with much greater efficiency, but this is what I created with the tools I currently have.
I hope to continue updating and bug-fixing each of my projects over time, while continuing to create more fun and interesting things when time allows.
